# Subskill - Interview Test
"As a solo developer, I successfully executed a project for Subskill, which revolved around converting a Figma design into a fully functional webpage. The main goal was to faithfully replicate the Figma template using HTML and CSS, ensuring a smooth integration of design and development. Every effort was made to closely match the layout, typography, colors, and visual elements.

Throughout the project, I followed a systematic approach to extract design details from Figma and translate them into well-structured HTML elements. CSS was utilized to apply precise styling, guaranteeing consistency with the original design. Additionally, I implemented responsive design principles to ensure the webpage's visual appeal across various screen sizes and devices.

By adhering closely to the Figma template, I successfully delivered a webpage that captures Subskill's vision while offering a seamless user experience. The integration process highlighted my proficiency in HTML and CSS, as well as my dedication to maintaining the integrity of the original design."



## Here is the Roadmap is used during this project

- FigJam : Construct a proper sementic project (i've tried)

- Split in parts my work like in the differents JS Framerworks

- Desktop version (i had to do it first in case i'd ran out of time)

- Mobile and Tablet version (Was easier)

- Javascript for animations and modals

- Debug using browser console + w3c


## Tech Stack

**Client:** HTMLS5 , CSS , JavaScript

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?


While building this project, I encountered several valuable learning experiences that significantly contributed to my growth as a developer. One of the notable challenges I faced was the decision to avoid using frameworks. Initially, I was somewhat overwhelmed by the prospect of not relying on pre-existing solutions, but as I delved into the process, it became a rewarding opportunity to explore the depth of native HTML and CSS.

Navigating the intricacies of building the webpage without the crutch of frameworks led me to a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts. I gained insights into how different HTML elements interact and how CSS properties influence the design. This hands-on approach taught me to be more deliberate in my coding decisions and to have a greater appreciation for the foundational elements of web development.

While overcoming the challenges of framework-less development, I discovered the joy of crafting a solution from scratch and witnessing the direct impact of each line of code. The project not only enhanced my technical skills but also instilled a sense of accomplishment that comes from building something from the ground up.

In essence, the experience allowed me to grow both as a developer and as an individual who appreciates the craftsmanship that goes into web development. It highlighted the importance of adapting to challenges and embracing the learning process, ultimately leading to a more well-rounded skill set and a newfound enthusiasm for working with native HTML and CSS."
